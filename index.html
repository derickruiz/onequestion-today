    <h2>Improve your life one question a day.</h2>
    <p>The most successful people understand the power of questions. Tony Robbins says that your questions shape your life. Tim Ferris has written two books already on just asking questions to experts.</p>
    <p>What if you could answer a single question a day and start improving your life?</p>
    <p>I quickly became aware that questions really do shape the course of your life, but trying to answer so many questions about yourself at once can quickly becoming overwhelming. What if you just answered one per day?
    <p>What if there were courses that allowed me to answer a single question per day on various topics to improve my life? A good series of questions on how to improve your finances, your thoughts towards fitness, health, gratitude, finding your life's purpose.</p>
    <p>OneQuestion.today is that. A website where you can subscribe to different courses and begin improving your life a single question a day.</p>
